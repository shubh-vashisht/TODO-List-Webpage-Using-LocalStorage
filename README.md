# TODO-List-Webpage-Using-LocalStorage
Implementation of a todo list on a webpage using local storage of a web browser. 

Used JSON to store information on the localstorage by first converting data into a string. Then everytime we update the list, 
we first parse string that we stored intially by JSON.parse, and then apply JAVAscript array methods to process them.
